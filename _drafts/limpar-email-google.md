Click the down arrow in Gmail’s search bar to open the create filter form.
In the “Has the words” field, type unsubscribe.
Click the “Create filter with this search” link.
Check the box next to “Delete it.”
Click the “Create filter” button.
Now, any email that contains the word unsubscribe—which will cover the majority of the newsletters and marketing emails you receive—will be automatically sent to your trash folder

If you find that this filter isn’t catching everything, expand it to include other words that are commonly found in newsletters and marketing emails. Open your filter to edit it, and add all of the words you want to filter on, separating each with the OR operator.

unsubscribe OR “view in browser” OR “view as a web page” OR “privacy policy” OR “click here” OR “view online” OR “update your preferences” OR “opt out” OR “manage your account”

Caution: Gmail will automatically delete every email that uses one of the keywords or phrases in your filter. You only have 30 days to recover deleted items from the trash before they’re permanently deleted. If you think the filter might catch a personal email, make sure to skim through your deleted items at least once a month, or consider using the archiving method described in the next example.
